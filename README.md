# Dataset
Arxiv GR-QC Dataset statistics Nodes: 5242 Edges: 14496 Average Degree: 5.5307 Average clustering coefficient: 0.6055

This dataset is an unweighted collaboration network from the e-print arXiv and covers scientific collaborations between authors of the papers submitted to the General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology category. The graph is undirected and creates an edge from i to j, if an author i co-authored a paper with author j.

The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003 (124 months). It begins within a few months of the inception of the arXiv, and thus represents essentially the complete history of its GR-QC section.
